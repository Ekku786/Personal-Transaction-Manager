✅ Project Title:
Personal Transaction Manager with API Integration (Axios)

📝 Project Description:
The Personal Transaction Manager is a web-based dashboard that helps users manage their personal finances by recording credit and debit transactions. The system interacts with backend APIs using Axios to perform all key operations such as user login, balance fetch, transaction entry, and listing.

Built with HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Axios, the application supports:

✅ User authentication (login/signup)

✅ Real-time transaction listing (fetched using API)

✅ Adding Credit and Debit entries
